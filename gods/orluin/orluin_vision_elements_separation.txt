Orluin's Pixie and the Separation of the Elements
(from Watashahim's baptism and vision)

After imbibing a hallucinatory or magical or miraculous substance, Watashahim and the other followers of Orluin (Graxis, Estelian) saw a vision of Orluin's pixie.

The vision was of the separation of the elements.

In the beginning, all matter was swirled together.

Orluin separated the elements, from top to bottom:

Fire
Air
Water
Earth
