Molas, Secra, Ysif, the Minotaurs, and the Wyrd Tapestry
In which Ra'ziel the fire wyrd becomes a legend of the North

Molas and Secra are veders.
Lamoria is the secret home of Molas and Secra.
The wyrds might have seen Lamoria when we were teleported (by Ysif?) to the room with the fire cages and the wyrd tapestry.

Molas and Secra made the minotaurs, who hate Haleth. Minotaurs can enslave humans as thralls. We encountered many of them - primarily Northlander spellcasters - fighting with the minotaurs. The thrall tattoo looks a bit like this:

Ergenai, the great bear veder, wants to kill the minotaurs, and succeeded in scattering them, so now they travel only in small groups.

It was claimed that Haleth slew Molas. Ysif, the self-styled obsidian wyrd, said that he wanted the Cloister to hunt the minotaurs and search for the wyrd tapestry, which he said they had in their possession.

We fought through many minotaurs and came to a cave. In it, a woman with bovine legs and horns fought us - Secra. When she was near death, Ysif ate her spirit to absorb her power and disappeared. The wyrds then realized that he had been taken over by corruption after sacrificing himself in Erlestan, and possessed by Molas.

Later that night, he teleported all of the wyrds to a cave - possibly Lamoria, the home of Molas and Secra - and locked the rest of us into fire cages while he fought Ra'ziel. He tried to kill us in the cages, but with our magic we revived each other. The might of Valinog flooded into Ra'ziel, and he was able to defeat Ysif-Molas. Then most of the wyrds reappeared in the Northlander hall where we'd been taken from, at the point of death. Ra'ziel, Ranu, and Dak saw the wall of rock and ice at the back of Secra's lair collapse. Behind it was the wyrd tapestry and a wooden chair. They received visions of their xxxxx and were then teleported to just outside the Northlander hall with the tapestry.
