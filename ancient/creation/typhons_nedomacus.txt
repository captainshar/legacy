Typhons & Veders at the Beginning of Sapience - Including Nedomacus
(vision at the stone altar to Doru in the Northlands (Runstringe))

As the worshippers of Doru prayed before her ancient stone altar with the etching of a cow behind it, we saw a vision of the beginning of Sapience and the typhons. One of them was Nedomacus!

In the vision, the motherly cow, Ad Hamla, has six teats. Six weak typhons (also known as veders) drank her milk and grew strong.
